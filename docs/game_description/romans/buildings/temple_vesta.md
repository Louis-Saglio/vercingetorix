## Guide

The Temple of Vesta is the roman temple, available from Town phase for 300 stone. It is the only roman source of healers (`support_healer_b`) and its 20-slot garrison heals occupants at +3 HP/s, so build one near the front or the economy to keep troops and workers alive. Its Eternal Fire aura also gives friendly structures within 75 m +50% capture points, making it a defensive anchor against enemy captures. Because it is ConquestCritical, it must be protected in `conquest_civic_centers`-style victory conditions.
