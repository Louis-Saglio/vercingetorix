## Guide

Marcellus is the roman hero cavalry swordsman, trained at the fortress for 300 food, 150 wood and 300 metal, costing 0 population — metal-intensive, so a premium unit that is hard to mass. He is a durable front-line fighter (1200 HP, 26 hack damage at 0.75 s repeat) whose real value is his auras: within 60 m he boosts the attack damage of all own cavalry by 15 %, and within 30 m he cuts enemy infantry damage by 10 % — so he belongs embedded in a cavalry strike force rather than fighting alone. His 18 m/s walk / 25.2 m/s run speed and Capture attack (strength 10) also make him suited to fast raids and capturing buildings. Train one as a force multiplier once a fortress is up and cavalry production is running.
