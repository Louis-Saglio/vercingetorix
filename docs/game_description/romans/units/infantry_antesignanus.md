## Guide

The Legionary Skirmisher is the romans' elite ranged citizen-soldier, trained at the army camp. It fights at 30 m with a fast 16-pierce javelin attack (preferred target Human) while still gathering resources at CitizenSoldier rates, making it a flexible pick for an army camp producing both economy and combat units. Already Elite rank, it costs only 50 food, 50 wood, 15 metal and 1 population, so it is a cheap way to add ranged firepower, though its 50 HP and 1 hack/pierce armor make it fragile in melee.
