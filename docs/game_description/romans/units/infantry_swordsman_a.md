## Guide

The Roman Swordsman is Rome's core melee infantry, trained at the Army Camp (`structures/rome/army_camp`) and starting directly at Advanced rank. At 50 food / 40 wood / 10 metal it is a cheap all-rounder: it fights with an 8-hack sword attack, can capture buildings (strength 2.5), and doubles as an economic worker that gathers all resources and builds roman structures — but its gather rate degrades as it ranks up (×0.7 per promotion), so veteran swordsmen are best kept fighting. With experience it promotes for free to Elite and eventually to the champion-grade Legionary (195 HP, hack 10.65), making long-lived swordsman squads the backbone of a roman army.
