## Guide

Scipio is a hero cavalry swordsman trained at the fortress, meant to fight alongside the army rather than alone: his Triumph aura gives nearby Soldiers and Siege Engines +2 capture strength and +20% melee and ranged damage, so his value scales with the size of the force he accompanies. He is himself a durable, fast fighter (1200 HP, 25.2 m/s run, 26 hack damage against units, plus a capture attack) and costs 0 population, but the 300 food / 150 wood / 300 metal price — metal-intensive, so a premium unit — and 50 s train time make him an investment for a developed economy.
