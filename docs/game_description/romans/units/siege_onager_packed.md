## Guide

The Roman siege catapult (onager) is the late-game building destroyer: 40 crush damage per hit plus a 160-crush splash (4 m radius, no friendly fire) at 60 m range. It is trained at the army camp or arsenal (300 wood plus 150 stone, a scarce resource, and 3 population) and requires the `roman_reforms` technology, so it is a deliberate investment, not an early unit. This packed form moves; it must unpack (`units/rome/siege_onager_unpacked`) to fire, and it cannot shoot targets closer than 20 m, so it needs an escort. For a bot, build a few once reforms are researched to crack enemy civic centres and fortifications that normal units grind down slowly.
