# Game mechanics of 0 A.D. 0.28.0

One file per **game mechanic**, written for an agent implementing a bot. Unlike the
`units/` / `buildings/` / `technologies/` / `auras/` folders (which catalogue
*data*), these files explain *how the simulation works*: formulas, timings,
edge cases, and what a bot can observe or must do.

**Everything here was verified against the pinned game copy at
`/home/ubuntu/0ad-reference/` (0.28.0)** — the simulation components
(`public/simulation/components/*.js`), helpers (`public/simulation/helpers/*.js`),
data (`public/simulation/data/**`), templates (`public/simulation/templates/**`)
and engine source (`source/source/simulation2/**`). Nothing was written from
memory; every claim carries an inline `path:line` citation. If a statement looks
wrong, trust the source, not the doc — and fix the doc.
