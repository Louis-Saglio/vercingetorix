## Guide

Vercingetorix is the gaul hero: a fast (run 25.2 m/s), very durable (1200 HP, 25 crush armor) cavalry swordsman that costs no population, making it a strong addition to any army. Its 300 metal (a scarce resource) on top of 300 food / 150 wood makes it a premium investment rather than a unit to mass. Its "Celtic Warlord" aura (from the source template) gives Soldiers and Siege Engines within 60 m +1 capture attack strength and +20% melee and ranged damage, so it is most valuable fighting at the head of an army rather than alone. Its own Capture attack (strength 10, 1 s repeat) supports assaults on buildings.
