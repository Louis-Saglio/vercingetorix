## Guide

Viridomarus is the gaul hero: a tanky (1000 HP, high armor) infantry spearman trained once at the assembly for 200 food, 200 wood, 150 metal and no population cost. The 150 metal is a scarce resource, so he is a premium investment rather than a unit to mass — though he is trained only once anyway. His 2.5× attack bonus vs Cavalry makes him a strong anti-cavalry fighter, and his global "Preparation for War" aura gives all Workers +15% gather speed, so training him early pays off economically even without fighting.
