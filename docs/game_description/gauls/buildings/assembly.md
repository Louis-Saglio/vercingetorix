## Guide

The Assembly of Princes is the gauls' city-phase elite structure: once phase_city is reached, it is the only place to train the champion infantry trumpeter and the three gaul heroes (Brennus, Viridomarus, Vercingetorix). At 400 wood and a 200 s build time it is a modest investment for unlocking the roster's top-tier units, and its 40 m territory influence with weight 40000 also helps expand or hold territory. Its 20 garrison slots let it shelter units, and because it is ConquestCritical, losing it matters in conquest-type victories — build it when pushing for champions/heroes, and defend it.
