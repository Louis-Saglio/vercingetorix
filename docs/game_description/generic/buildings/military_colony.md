# military_colony

Buildable by **2** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) building of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/buildings/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_structure_civic_civil_centre_military_colony` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

The Military Colony is a compact expansion structure for the Ptolemaic and Seleucid civilisations: a small Civic Centre (`Colony` class) that can be built in own **or neutral** territory, at least 120 m from an existing Civil Centre. Its territory root (radius 75 m, weight 10000) plants a new border far from your main base, and it adds +20 population, trains civilians (and mercenary infantry/cavalry for ptol/sele), and defends itself with a ranged attack. Available from the town phase for 200 wood, 200 stone and 150 metal — a premium investment in scarce stone and metal — it is the tool to claim distant territory and forward training capacity without building a full Civic Centre.
