# theater

Buildable by **5** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) building of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/buildings/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_structure_special_theater` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

The Theater is a City-phase territory-expansion building: it has a territory influence of radius 100 m / weight 40000 itself, and its global stackable aura "Hellenization" increases the territory influence radius of all your structures by +20%. It is a pure strategic investment — it trains no units and researches nothing, and costs 200 wood, 600 stone, 200 metal — a heavy premium investment, since stone and metal are scarce — plus a long 500 s build time, so build it only when pushing borders matters more than immediate military or economic spending. Its `BuildRestrictions` category "Theater" limits it to one per player, and it does not root new territory (`TerritoryInfluence/Root` is false), so it extends existing borders rather than founding new ones.
