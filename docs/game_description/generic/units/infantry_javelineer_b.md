# infantry_javelineer_b

Trained by **11** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) unit of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/units/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_unit_infantry_ranged_javelineer` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

The Infantry Javelineer is the cheap basic-rank ranged citizen-soldier: 50 food + 50 wood, 10 s build time, trained at the barracks (and at the civil centre for several civilisations, including gaul and rome). Its Javelin attack deals 16 pierce damage at 30 m range with Human as preferred target, so its battlefield role is dealing damage from behind a melee line. With only 50 HP and 1 hack / 1 pierce armor it is fragile and must be kept out of melee; as a CitizenSoldier it also gathers resources between fights, making it a safe early-game train. Note that some civilisations (athen, ptol) shift its cost to metal, which changes when it is worth training.
