# siege_lithobolos_packed

Trained by **4** civilisations. Generic (non-civ-specific) unit of 0 A.D. 0.28.0 — see `docs/game_description/generic/units/README.md` for the method.

Generic stats resolved from the shared template `simulation/templates/template_unit_siege_stonethrower` (deepest template common to all civilisation variants; variants may override, see below).

## Guide

Heavy anti-building artillery: its 230 crush damage per shot at 85 m range, with Structure as the preferred target class, makes it the dedicated tool for demolishing enemy structures, and it is ConquestCritical, so it counts toward conquest-style victories. This is the packed (mobile) form — it must be unpacked before it can fire and re-packed (5 s) to move. Expensive (400 wood, 250 stone, 3 population) and trained only at the arsenal by athen, mace, ptol and sele, so it is a late investment best escorted rather than sent alone. A bot should queue it once it has a secure economy and a target civic centre or fortress to destroy.
